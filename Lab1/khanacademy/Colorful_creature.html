        <h1>The coolest creature</h1>
        
        <p>The <em>cat</em> is awesome because <strong>cats</strong> also called domestic cats (Felis catus), are small, carnivorous (meat-eating) mammals, of the family Felidae. Domestic cats are often called house cats when they are kept as indoor pets. Cats have been domesticated (tamed) for nearly 10,000 years. Domesticated cats who live on farms to keep rodents away are called farm cats. Feral cats are domestic cats that live away from humans..</p>
