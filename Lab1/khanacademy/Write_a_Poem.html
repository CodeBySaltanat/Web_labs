    <h1>From My Heart</h1>
    <p>A million stars up in the sky.<br>
    One shines brighter - I can't deny. <br>
    A love so precious, a love so true,<br>
    a love that comes from me to you.<br>
    The angels sing when you are near.<br>
    Within your arms I have nothing to fear.<br>
    You always know just what to say.<br>
    Just talking to you makes my day.<br>
    I love you, honey, with all of my heart.<br>
    Together forever and never to part.</p>
